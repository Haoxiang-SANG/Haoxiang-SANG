# Introduce myself

I'm a first-year undergraduate at [Anhui University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anhui_University).  
Competitions motivate my spirit in my daily life, especially program, math and CTF.  
I major in Infomation Security at AHU, and I am very fortunate to be advised by [Jie Cui](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=KL-Ik_wAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).  
I am seeking for some partners around the world. If you're interesting in me, please contact me at sanghaoxiang@gmail.com
