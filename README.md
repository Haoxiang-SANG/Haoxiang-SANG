# Introduce myself

Hi! I’m a duck — and not just any duck. I’m a big, fluffy, proudly “fat” duck: round for aerodynamics, soft for comfort, and heavy enough to make a splash when I dive into new ideas.

I’m a fifth-year “freshman” at China Agricultural University, starting a new chapter with the curiosity of a newcomer and the stubbornness of a duck that refuses to stop paddling. Before this, I studied Information Security at Anhui University, where I built a solid foundation in systems, security thinking, and problem-solving under pressure.

These days, my heart (and belly) are set on the future: I’m especially interested in large language models and embodied intelligence — how we can make models not only think and talk, but also perceive, act, and learn in the real world. I love the intersection of intelligence, engineering, and deployment: turning research ideas into systems that actually work.

If you’re into ambitious goals, practical tech, and a teammate who’s calm on the surface but paddling like crazy underneath — you’ve found your duck.

Nice to meet you. I’m the Big Fat Duck, and I’m here to learn, build, and keep moving forward. 🦆
